DESCRIPTION:Most of us use mobile messaging every day. We use certain app
 s that we chose for a number of factors\, like our friends using it\, go
 od press\, privacy promises\, or simply their feature sets. This talk ai
 ms to enable more of us to reason about the privacy and security of mess
 aging apps. We will try to present simple analogies translating abstract
  security and privacy expectations into concrete feature sets. We will i
 llustrate these features using the the popular messaging app Threema. Ou
 r analysis of its protocol is based on our own reverse-engineering effor
 ts and a re-implementation of the Threema protocol that we will release 
 during the talk.
