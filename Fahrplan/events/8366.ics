DESCRIPTION:Even though the Snowden revelations for the first time clearl
 y show that mass surveillance of communications is carried out on a glob
 al level\, little knowledge seems to be available to the general public 
 as well as the hacker community how these so-called COMINT operations ac
 tually work. The talk focuses on mass surveillance based on methods know
 n from research of the interdiscplinary field of Computationanal Linguis
 tics (or Natural Language Processing) and demonstrates how generation of
  selectors for mass surveilling text messages can occur.
