DESCRIPTION:As a soft roboticist I am constantly searching for inspiratio
 n for novel soft actuators\, and as a home cook and artist I consider ea
 ting an object to be a high-level form of interactivity. Having noted th
 e similarities between cast silicone and gummi candies it was natural to
  combine these interests. I will share my experiments in assessing diffe
 rent candies for their engineering potential\, and show my work-in-progr
 ess for sweet soft robots.
