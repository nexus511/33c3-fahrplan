DESCRIPTION:<p>To break into a building\, several methods have already be
 en discussed\, such as trying to find the code\npaths of a digicode\, cl
 one RFID cards\, use some social engineering attacks\, or the use of arc
 haic methods\nlike lockpicking a door lock or breaking a window.</p>\n<p
 >New methods are now possible with recent intercoms.\nIndeed\, these int
 ercoms are used to call the tenants to access the building. But little s
 tudy has been\nperformed on how these boxes communicate to request and g
 rant access to the building.</p>\n<p>In the past\, they were connected w
 ith wires directly to apartments. Now\, these are more practical and\nal
 low residents to open doors not only from their classic door phone\, but
  to forward calls to their home\nor mobile phone. Private houses are now
  equipped with these new devices and its common to find these\n“connecte
 d” intercoms on recent and renovated buildings.</p>\n<p>In this short pa
 per we introduce the Intercoms and focus on one particular device that i
 s commonly\ninstalled in buildings today. Then we present our analysis o
 n an interesting attack vector\, which already\nhas its own history. Aft
 er this analysis\, we present our environment to test the intercoms\, an
 d show some\npractical attacks that could be performed on these devices.
  During this talks\, the evolution of our mobile lab and some advances o
 n the 3G intercoms\, and M2M intercoms attacks will be also presented.</
