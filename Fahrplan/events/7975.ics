DESCRIPTION:The participation of women in computer education is low\; und
 ergraduate classrooms in Germany were only 10% female in 2000[1]. The pi
 cture at the primary school level is fuzzier\, as students do not declar
 e majors at that level\, but evidence indicates the trend starts from a 
 young age. Can we make computer education more gender-inclusive? Present
 ing technology in familiar\, non-threatening contexts can lead to more b
 alanced gender participation. For example\, Chibitronics uses the contex
 t of papercraft to present electronics to beginners\; the familiarity of
  papercraft improves the participation of women of all ages in the creat
 ion of electronics. Based on these learnings\, we have devised the “Love
  to Code” platform\, an open source hardware-to-cloud stack which combin
 es the familiarity of paper craft with a web-based\, driver-free embedde
 d firmware development environment based on FSK audio provisioning via a
  headphone jack. In this talk\, we will dive into the novel open source 
 technical contributions of this platform\, which includes the audio-base
 d provisioning protocol and the unique rigid-flex design of the circuitr
 y enabling papercraft integration\, as well as the multi-threaded client
  OS and cloud infrastructure required to complete the picture. This comb
 ination of new technology with familiar interfaces aims to lower the bar
 rier to computer education\, thus making coding a more accessible and in
 clusive activity.
