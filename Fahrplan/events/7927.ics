DESCRIPTION:At 32C3 we shot lasers into space... now it's lasers in space
 !\nWe look at space- and airborne laser platforms and what practical use
 s people have come up with (hint: mostly more or less secret communicati
 on and military use).  We'll also recap the basic physics and boundaries
  and check if 'pew pew pew' is really gonna cut it (hint: mostly no). To
  close\, we'll have a look at laser based propulsion for space travel an
 d other speculative applications off the beaten path.
