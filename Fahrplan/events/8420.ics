DESCRIPTION:I would like to present my project called Anthropology for ki
 ds and a specific book\, that I am working on in the larger framework of
  this project.  \nThis book will look like an ordinary school notebook i
 n which a teacher checks a student if the lesson had been learnt. But it
  is actually not! I gathered this collection of historical and anthropol
 ogical notes\, so that together with school kids we can think about how 
 the very idea of privacy was developed in different countries and in dif
 ferent historical epochs. In ancient Babylon wealthy women were allowed 
 to cover their faces and their bodies\, but the poor ones were not. In t
 he Soviet Union during Stalin times it was dangerous to tell a political
  joke even in the group of close friends. One of them may report a joke 
 to the authorities. Punishment for a political joke could be a prison se
 ntence. \nToday more or less all our online communication is watched or 
 recorded by authorities.\nHow does our present relate to other times in 
 history\, how is the western notion of privacy related to the ideas in o
 ther cultures.
