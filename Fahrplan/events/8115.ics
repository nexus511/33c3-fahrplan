DESCRIPTION:In August 2016\, Apple issued updates to iOS and macOS that p
 atched three zero-day vulnerabilities that were being exploited in the w
 ild to remotely install persistent malcode on a target’s device if they 
 tapped on a specially crafted link. We linked the vulnerabilities and ma
 lcode to US-owned\, Israel-based NSO Group\, a government-exclusive surv
 eillance vendor described by one of its founders as “a complete ghost”.
