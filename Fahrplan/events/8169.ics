DESCRIPTION:Applied IT security is largely a science-free field. The IT-S
 ecurity industry is selling a range of products with often very question
 able and sometimes outright ridiculous claims. Yet it's widely accepted 
 practice among users and companies that protection with security applian
 ces\, antivirus products and firewalls is a necessity. There are no rigo
 rous scientific studies that try to evaluate the effectiveness of most s
 ecurity products or strategies. Evidence-based IT security could provide
  a way out of the security nihilism that's often dominating the debate â€“
  however it doesn't exist yet.
