DESCRIPTION:Software Defined Radios (SDRs) became a mainstream tool for w
 ireless engineers and security researches and there are plenty of them a
 vailable on the market. Most if not all SDRs in the affordable price ran
 ge are using USB2/USB3 as a transport\, because of implementation simpli
 city. While being so popular\, USB has limited bandwidth\, high latency 
 and is not really suitable for embedded applications. PCIe/miniPCIe is t
 he only widespread bus which is embedded friendly\, low latency and high
  bandwidth at the same time. But implementing PCIe/miniPCIe is not for t
 he faint of heart - you have to write your own FPGA code\, write your ow
 n Linux kernel driver and ensure compatibility with different chipsets\,
  each with its own quirks. In this talk we will look at the requirements
  for a high performance SDR like XTRX\, how this leads to certain design
  decisions and share pitfalls and gotchas we encountered (and solved).
