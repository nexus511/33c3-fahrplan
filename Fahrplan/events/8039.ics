DESCRIPTION:For the past three years we studied the world’s largest 3D pr
 inting community “Thingiverse”. We explored the remix-relationships—acce
 ssible due the community’s use of open licenses—of more than 200.000 ind
 ividual designs\, tracked an entire week’s new designs for half a year\,
  interviewed more than 80 creators and surveyed over 200 more. This allo
 wed us to develop a deep understanding of the creative processes that ta
 ke place on the platform.\nIn this talk we would like to present our fin
 dings. This is of interest to people who care about 3D printing as we ca
 n give sort of a behind the scenes view on how ideas come to life here. 
 But it is also interesting to people that care about creativity in gener
 al. As what we have found has merit outside of 3D printing\, too. In thi
 s talk we would like to cover the following: (1) Introduce our research 
 setting and explain why it is useful to study this\, (2) provide a conso
 lidated overview on our most interesting findings\, and (3) give real li
 fe examples for how these findings are transferable to other settings.\n
 We have presented primary results of the studies at various academic con
 ferences and have a comprehensive paper on the project currently under r
 evision at the Journal of Information Technology (see attached file). We
  are a group of three university professors and a Ph.D. student. We work
  on the intersection of information systems\, innovation management\, pr
 oduct development\, and creativity. We believe that many of the people w
 e studied either attend 33C3 or watch talks online and we therefore thin
 k that our results would be of interest to this community. Further\, we 
 feel that a well structured talk is better and more entertaining than ma
 iling around our academic journal publications to those who are interest
 ed. And lastly\, we are eager to receive feedback from a more hands-on a
 udience (than what we deal with at academic conferences). It would be es
 pecially useful for us to hear of new developments\, discuss ideas for f
 ollow-up research projects\, and get access to creators that would like 
 to work with us in the future.
