DESCRIPTION:The genome – the final frontier – or just a complex mess of l
 etters? Somewhere in there\, our eye or skin color is hidden. But also\,
  diseases can be diagnosed or predicted by analyzing the genome. More an
 d more research is committed to finding clues for diseases in our genes.
  The opportunity is clear: If I know about a disease I might get ahead o
 f time\, I could possibly intervene before it starts. Yet: How accurate 
 are these predictions and how meaningful are they? And more importantly:
  What happens to my genetic data once it has been decoded?
