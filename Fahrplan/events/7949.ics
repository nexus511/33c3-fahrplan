DESCRIPTION:Secure random number generators play a crucial role in the wi
 der security ecosystem. In the absence of a dedicated hardware True Rand
 om Number Generator (TRNG)\, computer systems have to resort to a softwa
 re (cryptographically secure) Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG). S
 ince the (secure) design of a CSPRNG is an involved and complicated effo
 rt and since randomness is such a security-critical resource\, many oper
 ating systems provide a CSPRNG as a core system service and many popular
  security software products assume their presence. The constraints impos
 ed by the embedded world\, however\, pose a variety of unique challenges
  to proper OS (CS)PRNG design and implementation which have historically
  resulted in security failures. In this talk we will discuss these chall
 enges\, how they affect the quality of (CS)PRNGs in embedded operating s
 ystems and illustrate our arguments by means of the first public analysi
 s of the OS random number generators of several popular embedded operati
 ng systems.
