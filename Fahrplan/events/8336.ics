DESCRIPTION:In the last two years\, the marketing industry started to sho
 w a fast increasing interest in technologies for user cross-device track
 ing\, proximity tracking\, and their derivative monetization schemes. To
  meet these demands\, a new ultrasound-based technology has recently eme
 rged and is already utilized in a number of different real-world applica
 tions. Ultrasound tracking comes with a number of desirable features (e.
 g.\, easy to deploy\, inaudible to humans)\, but alarmingly until now no
  comprehensive security analysis of the technology has been conducted. I
 n this talk\, we will publish the results of our security analysis of th
 e ultrasound tracking ecosystem\, and demonstrate the practical security
  and privacy risks that arise with its adoption. Subsequently\, we will 
 introduce some immediately deployable defense mechanisms for practitione
 rs\, researchers\, and everyday users. Finally\, we will initiate the di
 scussion for the standardization of ultrasound beacons\, and outline our
  proposed OS-level API that enables both secure and effortless deploymen
 t for ultrasound-enabled applications.
