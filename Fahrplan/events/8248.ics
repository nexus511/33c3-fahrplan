DESCRIPTION:Cities are emerging as a space for local action and local cha
 nge but also as dangerous spaces where social engineering\, exclusion by
  design and privatised policing take place rapidly\, without adequate fr
 ames to catch up and assure fundamental rights. Is the city the answer t
 o a new digital ecosystem\, with effective mechanisms to enforce it\, in
  the local government powers? \n\nSophisticated surveillance systems are
  approved by\, funded by and deployed by local authorities\, Cities are 
 emerging as the spaces where everything is controlled by invisible techn
 ology\, almost imperceptible in daily life. Those surveillance cameras n
 ow visible on street corners are replaced by systems of constant monitor
 ing integrated in the landscape. Cities of sensors collecting our data a
 ll day long\, where each movement is registered and stored\, where decis
 ions are automated and dehumanised. Monetised to optimise consumption\, 
 predict behaviour. Control people and the local and micro local level. \
 n\nBut cities are also the spaces where a different form of politics is 
 emerging\, from Rome to Barcelona\, from Madrid to Paris\, citizens are 
 taking back the domestic infrastructure. Is there the answer for digital
  sovereignty?\n
