DESCRIPTION:The 8-bit Game Boy was sold between 1989 and 2003\, but its a
 rchitecture more closely resembles machines from the early 1980s\, like 
 the Commodore 64 or the NES. This talk attempts to communicate "everythi
 ng about the Game Boy" to the listener\, including its internals and qui
 rks\, as well as the tricks that have been used by games and modern demo
 s\, reviving once more the spirit of times when programmers counted cloc
 k cycles and hardware limitations were seen as a challenge.
