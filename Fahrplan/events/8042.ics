DESCRIPTION:The talk is about the paging system\, an old technology in th
 e 90's\, used in healthcare\, ICS and government\, a systematic review o
 f security impacts that it brought to us in the age of SDR\, covering th
 e United States\, Canada\, England and Japan.  By sniffing known pager f
 requencies in the general vicinity of hospitals\, factories and public f
 acilities with a $20 DVB-T\, we discovered that not only is pager techno
 logy alive and kicking\, but much of the traffic is not encrypted\, resu
 lting in violation of privacy laws and more importantly\, leaks of sensi
 tive information.  The talk is not about the protocol nor the hardware d
 evice.
