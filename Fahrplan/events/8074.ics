DESCRIPTION:The 2016 U.S. presidential election was preceded by unprecede
 nted cyberattacks and produced a result that surprised many people in th
 e U.S. and abroad.  Was it hacked?  To find out\, we teamed up with scie
 ntists and lawyers from around the country&mdash\;and a presidential can
 didate&mdash\;to initiate the first presidential election recounts motiv
 ated primarily by e-voting security concerns.  In this talk\, we will ex
 plain how the recounts took place\, what we learned about the integrity 
 of the election\, and what needs to change to ensure that future U.S. el
 ections are secure.\n
