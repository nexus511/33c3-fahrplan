DESCRIPTION:Sednit\, a.k.a Fancy Bear/APT28/Sofacy\, is a group of attack
 ers\noperating since at least 2004 and whose main objective is to steal\
 nconfidential information from specific targets. Over the past two years
 \,\nthis group's activity increased significantly\, in particular with n
 umerous attacks against foreign affairs ministries and embassies all ove
 r the world. They are supposedly behind the DNC hack\, and the WADA hack
 \, which happened earlier this year. This talk presents the results of a
  two-year hunt after Sednit\, during which we dug up and analyzed many o
 f their software.\n\n
