<h2>lecture: The 12 Networking Truths</h2>

<p class="abstract">In *The 12 Networking Truths* Swedish artist Jonas Lund will discuss how he has attempted to subvert the contemporary art world system by using different types of exploits to gain an upper hand against the competition. </p>

<p class="abstract">From designing an algorithm for art production to data mining art world personalities, the artist will describe how he has incorporated a classic programming mindset in an otherwise logic-free environment. </p>

<p class="abstract">The 12 Networking Truths refers to RFC 1925 - The Twelve Networking Truths, a memo posted on the 1st of April 1996, positioned as revealing the fundamental truths underlying all network protocol designs. The truths include statements such as ‘It Has To Work.’ and ‘Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick any two (you can’t have all three).’. This memo will be the underlying story line throughout the talk, as each truths has a corresponding position within the artist’s artistic practice.

<p class="description">The Fear Of Missing Out
<br>http://jonaslund.biz/works/the-fear-of-missing-out/</p>

<p class="description">Showroom MAMA presents The Fear Of Missing Out, the latest exhibition by Swedish artist Jonas Lund (SE, 1984). The title derives from a social network induced anxiety condition. One brought on by trying to keep up with a rapidly moving world. A fear of constantly being one-step behind, in the wrong place, and missing out on the most exciting events. The Fear Of Missing Out proposes that it is possible to be one step ahead of the art world by using well-crafted algorithms and computational logic.</p>

<p class="description">The works in the show are the result of a computer algorithm written by Lund. By analysing and categorizing a wide range of artworks, by the most successful contemporary artists, a set of instructions were generated explaining, step by step, how to make the most successful works of art. The artist then simply made the work following the instructions. In The Fear of Missing Out, important categories from the art world such as authenticity, artistry, talent, and creativity are questioned. The title also refers to the urge to be a part of a transparent information society made up of an overarching digital network.</p>

<p class="description">Flip City
<br>http://jonaslund.biz/works/flip-city/
<br>Steve Turner Contemporary is pleased to present Flip City, a solo exhibition by Amsterdam-based artist Jonas Lund, who will present a group of paintings that are inspired by the current appetite for process-based abstraction; the related trend of collectors/investors buying such works to flip them quickly for a profit; and the central role that Los Angeles has played in both realms.</p>

<p class="description">For Flip City, Lund will create forty digital paintings, of which a selection will be on view during the run of the exhibition and the others will be presented at art fairs in Europe, Latin America and the United States during the next twelve months. Each work has elements sampled from paintings by other emerging artists, yet Lund’s works are so thoroughly remixed that only a very astute observer might see familiar passages. Lund will install a GPS tracking device on the stretcher bar of each painting so that he can track its movements and approximate whereabouts. He will also maintain a website with this information in the years to come.</p>

<p class="description">STRINGS ATTACHED
<br>http://jonaslund.biz/works/strings-attached/</p>

<p class="description">Steve Turner is pleased to present Strings Attached, a solo exhibition by Amsterdam-based artist Jonas Lund which will feature 24 text-based paintings that relate to the current “bubble moment” in contemporary art. Each work uses text that restricts the transfer of ownership in some way, such as “This painting may never be sold at auction” or “This painting must be resold by March 21, 2017.” Lund uses fabric wallpaper as backgrounds for the works, and their messages have been painted by a sign painter according to Lund’s directions. As a group, the 24 paintings encompass contradictory efforts made by gallerists who both want to fuel market momentum for their artists while trying to shield them from the damaging effects of quick-profit speculation.
