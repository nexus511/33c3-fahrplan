DESCRIPTION:Physicists are not computer scientists. But at CERN and world
 wide\, they need to analyze petabytes of data\, efficiently. Since more 
 than 20 years now\, ROOT helps them with interactive development of anal
 ysis algorithms (in the context of the experiments' multi-gigabyte softw
 are libraries)\, serialization of virtually any C++ object\, fast statis
 tical and general math tools\, and high quality graphics for publication
 s. I.e. ROOT helps physicists transform data into knowledge.\n\nThe pres
 entation will introduce the life of data\, the role of computing for phy
 sicists and how physicists analyze data with ROOT. It will sketch out ho
 w some of us foresee the development of data analysis given that the res
 t of the world all of a sudden also has big data tools: where they fit\,
  where they don't\, and what's missing.\n
