DESCRIPTION:Heads is an open source custom firmware and OS configuration 
 for laptops and servers that aims to provide slightly better physical se
 curity and protection for data on the system. Unlike Tails\, which aims 
 to be a stateless OS that leaves no trace on the computer of its presenc
 e\, Heads is intended for the case where you need to store data and stat
 e on the computer. It targets specific models of commodity hardware and 
 takes advantage of lessons learned from several years of vulnerability r
 esearch. This talk provides a high level overview of Heads\, a demo of i
 nstalling it on a Thinkpad and a tour of some of the attacks that it pro
 tects against.
