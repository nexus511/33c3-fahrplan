DESCRIPTION:Why is it so hard to go to the Moon? The curse of Newtonian M
 echanics and Tsiolkovsky's Rocket Equation force us to build huge rocket
 s to achieve any meaningful activity on the Moon. There are two strategi
 es to hack the laws of celestial mechanics: making fuel on the Moon and 
 using cables to climb out of the gravity well. Here we focus on the latt
 er\, which is the Moon version of the famous space elevator. The differe
 nce to an Earth elevator is - anelevator to the Moon's surface is realis
 tic with today's materials. In the talk an introduction to the general p
 roblem is given and a starting point for a discussion is given that can 
 easily lead to a sustainable access to the Moon if there is demand to do
  so.\n
