 ities and vulnerabilities used by Pegasus. We will focus on Pegasus’s fe
 atures and the exploit chain Pegasus used called Trident. Attendees will
  learn about Pegasus’s use of 0-days\, obfuscation\, encryption\, functi
 on hooking\, and its ability to go unnoticed. We will present our detail
 ed technical analysis that covers each payload stage of Pegasus includin
 g its exploit chain and the various 0-day vulnerabilities that the toolk
 it was using to jailbreak a device. After this talk attendees will have 
 learned all of the technical details about Pegasus and Trident and how t
