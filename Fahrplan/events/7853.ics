DESCRIPTION:Input/Output is the mechanisms through which embedded systems
  interact and control the outside world. Particularly when employed in m
 ission critical systems\, the I/O of embedded systems has to be both rel
 iable and secure. Embedded system’s I/O is controlled by a pin based app
 roach. In this work\, we investigate the security implications of embedd
 ed system’s pin control. In particular\, we show how an attacker can tam
 per with the integrity and availability of an embedded system’s I/O by e
 xploiting cerain pin control operations and the lack of hardware interru
 pts associated to them.
