DESCRIPTION:In this talk we will explore and present various IPv6 scannin
 g techniques that allow attackers to peek into IPv6 networks. With the a
 lready known difference between IPv4 and IPv6 firewalling (the latter is
  worse... ) we then demonstrate how these techniques can be combined and
  used to obtain a large-scale view on the state of IPv6 in infrastructur
 es and data centers. To give the whole issue a somewhat more fun dimensi
 on\, we will also look at some (security) sensitive applications of this
  technique. Complimentary code-snippets will be provided.
