DESCRIPTION:\nEarly digital computers were the size of rooms. While the d
 evices have gotten smaller\, because of the increasingly networked natur
 e of technology the room has gotten bigger--it's ceased having walls and
  started to cover the ocean floor and ascend into low earth orbit. While
  Neal Stephenson may have cornered this living-inside-a-computer narrati
 ve in 1996 with "Mother Earth\, Mother Board"\, in the past twenty years
  the seams of the network have become even more opaque\, subsumed into T
 he Cloud and other problematic abstractions. This talk will mostly be ab
 out different approaches to documenting\, comprehending\, and thinking a
 bout network infrastructure and the ways that the visual vernacular of t
 echnologies shape their history and politics. \n\n
