DESCRIPTION:A physically unclonable function\, or PUF\, is some physical 
 structure with properties that are easy to verify\, hard to predict\, an
 d practically impossible to clone. Ideally\, this means it's a device-un
 ique unchanging identifier\, which can be used for improving security. H
 owever\, it can be at odds with privacy and anonymity. This talk will gi
 ve you an overview of the thirty years of history behind PUFs\, and will
  include the most recent advances in research. The functions\, structure
 \, and design will be discussed\, as well as devices and materials that 
 have properties to base PUFs on.
