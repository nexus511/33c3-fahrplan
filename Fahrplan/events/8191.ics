DESCRIPTION:In *The 12 Networking Truths* Swedish artist Jonas Lund will 
 discuss how he has attempted to subvert the contemporary art world syste
 m by using different types of exploits to gain an upper hand against the
  competition. \n\nFrom designing an algorithm for art production to data
  mining art world personalities\, the artist will describe how he has in
 corporated a classic programming mindset in an otherwise logic-free envi
 ronment. \n\nThe 12 Networking Truths refers to RFC 1925 - The Twelve Ne
 tworking Truths\, a memo posted on the 1st of April 1996\, positioned as
  revealing the fundamental truths underlying all network protocol design
 s. The truths include statements such as ‘It Has To Work.’ and ‘Good\, F
 ast\, Cheap: Pick any two (you can’t have all three).’. This memo will b
 e the underlying story line throughout the talk\, as each truths has a c
 orresponding position within the artist’s artistic practice. \n
