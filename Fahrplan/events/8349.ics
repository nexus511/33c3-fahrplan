DESCRIPTION:In this lecture I wish to reflect on the maturation of the se
 curity and hacking communities and their role in larger societal and pol
 itical participation. We'll reflect on the predominant role that technol
 ogy has been growing into our lives\, and the responsibilities we have i
 n nurturing it. After having spent the last years in researching\, expos
 ing\, and preventing the electronic targeting of dissidents and journali
 sts\, I hope to synthesize my experience and suggest how to reconsider o
 ur tactics\, the successes\, and the failures\, and hopefully draw some 
 inspiration for a brighter future.
