DESCRIPTION:Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 is almost here. The protoc
 ol that protects most of the Internet secure connections is getting the 
 biggest ever revamp\, and is losing a round-trip. We will explore differ
 ences between TLS 1.3 and previous versions in detail\, focusing on the 
 security improvements of the new protocol as well as some of the challen
 ges we face around securely implementing new features such as 0-RTT resu
 mption. At Cloudflare we will be the first to deploy TLS 1.3 on a wide s
 cale\, and weâ€™ll be able to discuss the insights we gained while impleme
 nting and deploying this protocol.
