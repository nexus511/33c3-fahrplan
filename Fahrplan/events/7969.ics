DESCRIPTION:FinTechs increasingly cut the ground from under long-establis
 hed banks’ feet. With a "Mobile First" strategy\, many set their sights 
 on bringing all financial tasks—checking the account balance\, making tr
 ansactions\, arranging investments\, and ordering an overdraft—on your s
 martphone. In a business area that was once entirely committed to securi
 ty\, Fintechs make a hip design and outstanding user experience their on
 e and only priority. Even though this strategy is rewarded by rapidly in
 creasing customer numbers\, it also reveals a flawed understanding of se
 curity. With the example of the pan-European banking startup N26 (former
 ly Number26)\, we succeeded independently from the used device to leak c
 ustomer data\, manipulate transactions\, and to entirely take over accou
 nts to ultimately issue arbitrary transactions—even without credit.
