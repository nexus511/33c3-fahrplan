DESCRIPTION:In the last years\, technology-savvy artists and technologist
 s have taken over the art world with works addressing current societal a
 nd political issues. Their works are located at the intersection between
  art\, technology and activism and are dealing with a variety of problem
 s like free speech\, freedom of movement\, military and governmental pow
 er\, corporate and governmental surveillance to name just a few. This ta
 lk will present relevant works in this field and will draw connections b
 etween critical art and regulatory power\, warfare\, surveillance\, elec
 tronic waste\, electronic self-defense and the re-appropriation of archi
 tectural and technological artifacts in militant ways.
