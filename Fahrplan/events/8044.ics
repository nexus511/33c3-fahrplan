DESCRIPTION:Hardware is often considered as an abstract layer that behave
 s correctly\, just executing instructions and outputting a result. Howev
 er\, the internal state of the hardware leaks information about the prog
 rams that are executing. In this talk\, we focus on how to extract infor
 mation from the execution of simple x86 instructions that do not require
  any privileges. Beyond classical cache-based side-channel attacks\, we 
 demonstrate how to perform cache attacks without a single memory access\
 , as well as how to bypass kernel ASLR. This talk does not require any k
 nowledge about assembly. We promise.
