Rising superpowers around the world are working day and night to build the next stealth drone that can penetrate air defense systems. The automation of target selection processes, navigation and control are incentivized by the vulnerability posed by the signals drones rely upon to operate.\r\n\r\nA drone is merely a networked platform that moves across a grid, much like a mouse. It\u2019s \u201emind\u201c is distributed among dozens of individuals located around the globe, controlling separate parts of the the overall mission using data derived from surveillance, and processed using algorithms that may or may not reflect the reality on the ground. Cian challenges the common notion that drones are the most effective tool for combatting terrorism and seeks to explain why this is so, as well as how mistakes happen. The automation of these processes will further take the responsibility out of the hands of individuals and disperse them further. This calls for a new level of ethical considerations and accountability mechanisms to be developed.",

I will also discuss the extra-legal pressures placed upon companies, and the rise of government hacking and state-sponsored malware as an alternative or addition to weakening software. Finally, the presentation will discuss possible realistic outcomes, and give my predictions on what the state of the law will be as we head into 2017, and discuss how we can fight for a future that will allow for secure communications for everyone.\r\n\r\nThe discussion will include:\r\n- The law and policy issues in the FBI v. Apple iPhone case,\r\n- The FBI\u2019s purchase of 0day access to the iPhone 5c, and Apple\u2019s technical response,\r\n- The rise in use of government malware to access encrypted device\r\n-  Proposed and enacted crypto laws in the United States, Australia, India, Russia, and the UK,\r\n- Legal pressures on companies, like Brazil\u2019s arrest of Facebook executives to pressure WhatsApp,\r\n- Q&A with the audience.",

Unlike Tails, which aims to be a stateless OS that leaves no trace on the computer of its presence, Heads is intended for the case where you need to store data and state on the computer. It targets specific models of commodity hardware and takes advantage of lessons learned from several years of vulnerability research. This talk provides a high level overview of Heads, a demo of installing it on a Thinkpad and a tour of some of the attacks that it protects against.", 
                                "description": "Heads builds on several years of firmware security research focused on firmware vulnerabilities (\"Thunderstrike: EFI bootkits for Apple Macbooks\" and \"Thunderstrike 2\") as well as many other CCC talks (\"Hardening hardware and choosing a #goodBIOS\", \"Beyond anti evil maid\", \"Towards (reasonably) trustworthy x86 laptops\", etc.) and combines these ideas into a single system.\r\n\r\nIt is not just another Linux distribution - it combines physical hardening and flash security features with custom Coreboot firmware and a Linux boot loader in ROM.  This moves the root of trust into the write-protected ROM and prevents further modifications to the bootup code.  Controlling the first instruction the CPU executes allows Heads to measure every step of the boot process into the TPM, which makes it possible to attest to the user or a remote system that the firmware has not been tampered with.  While modern Intel CPUs require binary blobs to boot, these non-Free components are included in the measurements and are at least guaranteed to be unchanging.  Once the system is in a known good state, the TPM is used as a hardware key storage to decrypt the drive.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the hypervisor, kernel and initrd images are signed by keys controlled by the user, and the OS uses a signed, immutable root filesystem so that any software exploits that attempt to gain persistence will be detected.  While all of these firmware and software changes don't secure the system against every possible attack vector, they address several classes of attacks against the boot process and physical hardware that have been neglected in traditional installations, hopefully raising the difficulty beyond what most attackers are willing to spend.",

As well as finding which countries the FBI remotely searched computers in, I uncovered another operation led by a local Australian police department, which targeted individuals in the United States \u2013 clearly outside of the agency\u2019s jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nBecause many criminals suspects have moved onto the so-called dark web, law enforcement have no idea where the computers they are hacking are actually located.

With a \"Mobile First\" strategy, many set their sights on bringing all financial tasks\u2014checking the account balance, making transactions, arranging investments, and ordering an overdraft\u2014on your smartphone. In a business area that was once entirely committed to security, Fintechs make a hip design and outstanding user experience their one and only priority. Even though this strategy is rewarded by rapidly increasing customer numbers, it also reveals a flawed understanding of security. With the example of the pan-European banking startup N26 (formerly Number26), we succeeded independently from the used device to leak customer data, manipulate transactions, and to entirely take over accounts to ultimately issue arbitrary transactions\u2014even without credit.", 
                                "description": "Over the last few years, smartphones have become an omnipresent device that almost everybody owns and carries around all the time. Although financial institutions usually react conservatively to new technologies and trends, most established banks today offer their customers banking apps and app-based second-factor authentication methods. Fintechs, technology startups in the financial sector, pressure the tried and trusted structure of established banks, as they highlight the customer\u2019s smartphone as the hub of their financial life. This business model is especially appealing to younger customers. FinTechs, however, also play an important role in the advancing downfall of important conceptual security measures. While the latter can be understood as the next step in the decay process of second-factor authentication, which was started with the introduction of app-based legitimization methods, FinTechs also reveal limited insights into conceptual and technical security. We have encountered severe vulnerabilities at the Berlin-based FinTech N26, which offers their smartphone-only bank account to many countries throughout Europe. Entirely independent of the used device, we were not only able to reveal N26 customers and to manipulate transactions in real-time but also to completely take over a victim\u2019s bank account.",

We maintain that there is never a single cause, and every mistake a pilot may make has causes, and other factors contributing to it. We use the notion of a \"necessary causal factor\" to investigate the causes of accidents, and almost invariable there is a combination of both technical and human causal factors.\r\n\r\nI will look in some detail at accidents in which a combination of a technical problem, misleading or missing indications, and inappropriate (but often understandable) crew actions contributed to an accident, and also some in which unprecedented actions of the human crew turned a problem with potentially fatal consequences into a survivable accident.\r\n\r\nAutomation in modern airliners has become so reliable and useful that it may be argued that it leads to a deterioration of hand-flying skills and, perhaps more importantly, of decision-making skills.\r\n\r\nSample accident cases will include Asiana Flight 214, Spanair Flight 5022, Turkish Flight 1951, TAM Flight 3054 and others. I will also briefly touch on technical and ethical problems with self-driving vehicles highlighted by the recent Tesla crash as well as increasing automation in General Aviation and its consequences.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I will look at ways to improve safety and maintain the very high standard currently achieved in commercial aviation.",

                                "description": "This talk will hand you all the tools you need to go deeply into hacking smart devices. And you should! The only reason a huge bunch of these products doesn't even implement the most basic security mechanisms, might be that we don't hack them enough!\r\n\r\nWe start by looking at the hardware layer, dissecting PCBs and showing which chips are usually used for building those devices. Even if the firmware is read protected they still can be used as nice devboards with unusual pheripherals - if you can't flash it, you don't own it!\r\n\r\nBut you don't always have to get out your JTAG interfaces. The most simple part is intercepting an Apps communication with its servers. We show an easy Man-in-the-middle setup, which on the fly breaks the TLS encryption and lets you read and manipulate the data flowing through. This was enough to completely defeat the restrictions on a locks \"share to a friend\" feature and of course helps you recover your password...\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the API also is the best way to actually OWN your device - giving you the option to replace the vendors cloud service with an own backend. We show how this can be for example used to continue using your bike lock when the kickstarter you got it from goes bankrupt after a presentation about it's bad crypto. Just kidding, they are already notified and working on a patch. \r\n\r\nAlso going for the wireless interface and sniffing BTLE isn't as difficult as it might sound. Turning a cheap 10 EUR devboard into a sniffer we show how to use Wireshark to dissect the packets going from and to the device and analyze the payload. In some cases this is all what's needed to get the secret key from a single interaction...\r\n\r\nFinally we will turn into reverse engineers, showing how to decompile an android app and analyze it's inner working or even modify it to your needs. Using this we show, that a quite popular electronic padlock indeed correctly claims to use AES128, but due to a silly key exchange mechanism we can break it by listening to a single opening command. All details of this 0-day attack will be released during the talk - the vendor has been notified in May.\r\n\r\nLast but not least we will go back for the hardware layer, showing that sometimes even simple things like magnets or shims can be used to defeat $80+ electronic locks in seconds...",

But what do you do now?\r\n\r\nIn the past, console homebrew usually focused on bringing up a development environment similar to the one used for commercial games. However, with the increasing complexity of console hardware, it's becoming impractical for a small team of hackers to create a full blown development SDK. Using leaked official SDKs is illegal. What can we do? Well, there's Linux.\r\n\r\nThe PS4 is particularly great for Linux, because it is based on a modified x86 platform and a modified Radeon GPU. That means that once the basic OS port is complete, it can run existing games - even Steam games and other commercial software. But just how similar is the PS4 to a PC? Can you just throw GRUB on it and boot an Ubuntu kernel? Not quite.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll cover the PS4 hardware and part of its software environment, and how we reverse engineered enough of it to write Linux drivers and kernel patches. We'll go over how we went from basic code execution to building a 'kexec' function that can boot into Linux from the PS4's FreeBSD-based kernel. We'll reverse engineer the PS4's special hardware, from special PCI interrupt management to the HDMI encoder.  We'll dive deep into the Radeon-based GPU architecture, and we'll share some previously unreleased research and tools of interest to AMD Radeon driver developers and hackers.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in the strange world of x86 hardware that isn't quite a PC, then this talk is for you.",

We introduce two versions of the attack. The more general form exploits multiple unnoticed protocol flaws in SSLv2 to develop a new and stronger variant of the Bleichenbacher RSA padding-oracle attack. The victim client never initiates SSLv2 connections. We implemented the attack and can decrypt a TLS 1.2 handshake using 2048-bit RSA in under 8 hours, at a cost of $440 on Amazon EC2. Using Internet-wide scans, we find that 33% of all HTTPS servers and 22% of those with browser-trusted certificates are vulnerable to this protocol-level attack due to widespread key and certificate reuse.\r\n\r\nFor an even cheaper attack, we apply our new techniques together with a newly discovered vulnerability in OpenSSL that was present in releases from 1998 to early 2015. Given an unpatched SSLv2 server to use as an oracle, we can decrypt a TLS ciphertext in one minute on a single CPU\u2014fast enough to enable man-in-the-middle attacks against modern browsers. We find that 26% of HTTPS servers are vulnerable to this attack.\r\n\r\nThis talk gives an overview on the DROWN vulnerability for the hacker community with some background information that didn\u2019t make it to the paper.",

                                "abstract": "Artificial intelligence and machine learning are in a period of astounding growth. However, there are concerns that these technologies may be used, either with or without intention, to perpetuate the prejudice and unfairness that unfortunately characterizes many human institutions. We show for the first time that human-like semantic biases result from the application of standard machine learning to ordinary language\u2014the same sort of language humans are exposed to every day. We replicate a spectrum of standard human biases as exposed by the Implicit Association Test and other well-known psychological studies. We replicate these using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model\u2014namely, the GloVe word embedding\u2014trained on a corpus of text from the Web. Our results indicate that language itself contains recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether these are morally neutral as towards insects or flowers, problematic as towards race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo for the distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. These regularities are captured by machine learning along with the rest of semantics. In addition to our empirical findings concerning language, we also contribute new methods for evaluating bias in text, the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) and the Word Embedding Factual Association Test (WEFAT). Our results have implications not only for AI and machine learning, but also for the fields of psychology, sociology, and human ethics, since they raise the possibility that mere exposure to everyday language can account for the biases we replicate here.", 
                                "description": "There is no Alice and Bob in this talk. This talk is intended for an audience that genuinely cares for humanity and believes in equality while supporting fairness and acts against discrimination. This talk might not be interesting for folks who promote exclusion while discouraging diversity. Many of us have felt excluded in certain situations because of our gender, race, nationality, sexual orientation, disabilities, or physical appearance. This talk aims to communicate how big data driven machine learning is pushing the society towards discrimination, unfairness, and prejudices that harm billions of people every single day.\r\n\r\nThis year, I will not talk about de-anonymizing programmers, re-identifying underground forum members, or anonymous writing. I will be talking about a human right, namely equality, and the issue of unfairness which happens to be embedded in machines that make decisions about our future, what we see and read, or whether we go to prison or not.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMachine learning models are widely used for various applications that end up affecting billions of people and Internet users every day. Random forest classifiers guide the U.S. drone program to predict couriers that can lead to terrorists in Pakistan. Employers use algorithms, which might be racist, to aid in employment decisions. Insurance companies determine health care or car insurance rates based on machine learning outcomes. Internet search results are personalized according to machine learning models, which are known to discriminate against women by showing advertisements with lower salaries, while showing higher paying job advertisements for men. On the other hand, natural language processing models are being used for generating text and speech, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and sentence completion, which collectively influence search engine results, page ranks, and the information presented to all Internet users within filter bubbles. Given the enormous and unavoidable effect of machine learning algorithms on individuals and society, we attempt to uncover implicit bias embedded in machine learning models, focusing particularly on word embeddings. We show empirically that natural language necessarily contains human biases, and the paradigm of training machine learning on language corpora means that AI will inevitably imbibe these biases as well. \r\n\r\nWe look at \u201cword embeddings\u201d, a state-of-the-art language representation used in machine learning. Each word is mapped to a point in a 300-dimensional vector space so that semantically similar words map to nearby points. We show that a wide variety of results from psychology on human bias can be replicated using nothing but these word embeddings. We primarily look at the Implicit Association Test (IAT), a widely used and accepted test of implicit bias. The IAT asks subjects to pair concepts together (e.g., white/black-sounding names with pleasant or unpleasant words) and measures reaction times as an indicator of bias. In place of reaction times, we use the semantic closeness between pairs of words. In short, we were able to replicate every single implicit bias result that we tested, with high effect sizes and low p-values.\r\n\r\nThese include innocuous, universal associations (flowers are associated with pleasantness and insects with unpleasantness), racial prejudice (European-American names are associated with pleasantness and African-American names with unpleasantness), and a variety of gender stereotypes (for example, career words are associated with male names and family words with female names). We look at nationalism, mental health stigma, and prejudice towards the elderly. We also look at word embeddings generated from German text to investigate prejudice based on German data. We do not cherry pick any of these IATs, they have been extensively performed by millions of people from various countries and they are also available for German speakers (https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/germany/).\r\n\r\nWe go further. We show that information about the real world is recoverable from word embeddings to a striking degree. We can accurately predict the percentage of U.S. workers in an occupation who are women using nothing but the semantic closeness of the occupation word to feminine words! These results simultaneously show that the biases in question are embedded in human language, and that word embeddings are picking up the biases. \r\n\r\nOur finding of pervasive, human-like bias in AI may be surprising, but we consider it inevitable. We mean \u201cbias\u201d in a morally neutral sense. Some biases are prejudices, which society deems unacceptable. Others are facts about the real world (such as gender gaps in occupations), even if they reflect historical injustices that we wish to mitigate. Yet others are perfectly innocuous. Algorithms don\u2019t have a good way of telling these apart. If AI learns language sufficiently well, it will also learn cultural associations that are offensive, objectionable, or harmful. At a high level, bias is meaning. \u201cDebiasing\u201d these machine models, while intriguing and technically interesting, necessarily harms meaning.\r\n\r\nInstead, we suggest that mitigating prejudice should be a separate component of an AI system. Rather than altering AI\u2019s representation of language, we should alter how or whether it acts on that knowledge, just as humans are able to learn not to act on our implicit biases. This requires a long-term research program that includes ethicists and domain experts, rather than formulating ethics as just another technical constraint in a learning system.\r\nFinally, our results have implications for human prejudice. Given how deeply bias is embedded in language, to what extent does the influence of language explain prejudiced behavior? And could transmission of language explain transmission of prejudices? These explanations are simplistic, but that is precisely our point: in the future, we should treat these as \u201cnull hypotheses\u2019\u2019 to be eliminated before we turn to more complex accounts of bias in humans.",

Users can submit Net Neutrality violations on this website and thereby give them visibility and allow others to confirm, discuss and act upon them. As BEREC guidelines will be regurlaly reviewed this tool is of utmost importance to track the implementation of Net Neutrality rules as well as commercial practices by ISPs and mobile operators.\r\n\r\nRespectMyNet lived different lives, one of our current tasks is to make the tool and the submissions fit the new BEREC Guidelines in order to provide an easy to use and efficient tool for net neutrality activists in Europe.\r\n\r\nLet's protect the Internet as an open, free and neutral platform with the new rules the EU has given us.

The protocol that protects most of the Internet secure connections is getting the biggest ever revamp, and is losing a round-trip. We will explore differences between TLS 1.3 and previous versions in detail, focusing on the security improvements of the new protocol as well as some of the challenges we face around securely implementing new features such as 0-RTT resumption. At Cloudflare we will be the first to deploy TLS 1.3 on a wide scale, and we\u2019ll be able to discuss the insights we gained while implementing and deploying this protocol.", 
                                "description": "Version 1.3 is the latest Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which allows client/server applications to communicate over the Internet in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery. TLS is the S in HTTPS.\r\n\r\nA lot has changed between 1.2 (2008) and 1.3. At the a high level, 1.3 saves a round-trip, making most connections much faster to establish. We'll see how the 1.2 handshake worked, and what had to change to enable 1-RTT handshakes.\r\n\r\nBut even more importantly, the 1.3 design shifted towards putting robustness first. Anything that is not strictly necessary to the main function of TLS was removed (compression, renegotiation); choices of suboptimal security aren't offered at all (static RSA, CBC, RC4, SHA1, MD5); secure, easy to implement designs are introduced or privileged (RSA-PSS, AEAD implicit nonces, full handshake signatures, Curve25519, resumption forward secrecy). We will go into the why and how of all of these.\r\n\r\nBut two major trade-offs had to be made: first, 1-RTT handshakes inherently prevent the introduction of encrypted domain names (SNI). We'll see why and what can replace them to provide similar privacy.\r\n\r\nMost interestingly, 1.3 comes with 0-RTT resumption. The catch there is that the protocol itself provides no complete protection against replay attacks. We'll unpack the problem, see what mitigations are available, what the risks and attacks are and how that requires careful API design and deployment.\r\n\r\nFinally, deployment hasn't been entirely smooth. Many servers out there turned out to be intolerant to 1.3 clients. We'll see what this causes, how it was worked around, and how downgrade protection provides defense in depth.\r\n\r\nTLS 1.3 is not in the distant future. The draft is almost finalized, and at Cloudflare we developed an open source stack in Go and support the protocol in beta for all websites. Chrome Canary and Firefox Nightly implement 1.3 clients.",

With the already known difference between IPv4 and IPv6 firewalling (the latter is worse... ) we then demonstrate how these techniques can be combined and used to obtain a large-scale view on the state of IPv6 in infrastructures and data centers. To give the whole issue a somewhat more fun dimension, we will also look at some (security) sensitive applications of this technique. Complimentary code-snippets will be provided.", 
                                "description": "Scanning networks is a basic tool for security researchers. Software misconfiguration like with unprotected key-value stores and  software bugs like heartbleed are analyzed and investigated in the wild using scanning of networks.\r\n\r\nAt least since the rise of zMap, scanning the I---Pv4---nternet has become a rather simple endeavour. When one happens to be at a conference that tends to supply 1gE or 10gE ports on the access layer, scanning the Internet can be done in 60-10 Minutes. Scanning the 2^32 possible addresses (with certain limitations) of IPv4 has become cheap.\r\n\r\nHowever, the small searchspace of IPv4 that makes it so scannable is also what renders it increasingly obsolete. To overcome this issue, IPv6 was designed. Along with IPv6 we receive a theoretical maximum of 2^128 different addresses. Scanning this larger space is a challenge that---so far---has been mostly approached by researchers. Specifically, not security but network measurement researchers. Their works usually focus on having access to large datasets of  IPv6 addresses, the most famous ones using the access logs of a large CDN. \r\n\r\nWith the average nerd lacking a small enterprise scale CDN in the basement, we set out to utilize other techniques for enumerating IPv6 that only utilizes public data sources. Following RFC7707, we found various interesting candidate techniques. Especially probing the PTR sets of IPv6 networks sounded promising.\r\n\r\nHowever, when implementing the techniques, we had to realize that these were not yet ready to be used on a global scale. During the last couple of months we discovered pitfalls, adjusted the tools and ran enumerations.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will present the approaches we used to enumerate IPv6. From this presentation, the average person in the audience should be able to easily implement these tools for them self---with subsequent \"spasz am geraet\". Furthermore, we will present anecdotes, case-studies and investigations on the data we gathered so far. This includes peeks into transit networks of large ISPs, datacenters of global cloud providers and a suprisingly high amount of things one would not expect (or hope to be) on the Internet.",

On the other hand, hardware is often considered as an abstract layer that behaves correctly, just executing instructions and outputing a result. However, the internal state of the hardware leaks information about the programs that are running. Unlike software bugs, these bugs are not easy to patch on current hardware, and manufacturers are also reluctant to fix them in future generations, as they are tightly tied with performance optimizations.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we focus on how to extract information from the execution of simple x86 instructions that do not require any privileges. The most studied microarchitectural attacks are beyond doubt cache attacks. Indeed, the timing of a memory access depends heavily on the state of the CPU cache. But beyond memory accesses that are the base of classical cache-based side-channel attacks, other x86 instructions leak information about the internal state of the hardware, and thus about running programs. First, we present side channels caused by the \"clflush\" instruction, that flushes all content of the cache. We will explain how it can be used to perform side-channel attacks that are faster and stealthier than their classical counterpart, without performing so much as a single memory access [1]. Second, we present side channels caused by the prefetch instructions. We will explain how these instructions can be used to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses - without the use of the proc interface that is restricted today -, and to bypass kernel ASLR [2].\r\n\r\nThis talk does not require any knowledge about assembly.

Most if not all SDRs in the affordable price range are using USB2/USB3 as a transport, because of implementation simplicity. While being so popular, USB has limited bandwidth, high latency and is not really suitable for embedded applications. PCIe/miniPCIe is the only widespread bus which is embedded friendly, low latency and high bandwidth at the same time. But implementing PCIe/miniPCIe is not for the faint of heart - you have to write your own FPGA code, write your own Linux kernel driver and ensure compatibility with different chipsets, each with its own quirks. In this talk we will look at the requirements for a high performance SDR like XTRX, how this leads to certain design decisions and share pitfalls and gotchas we encountered (and solved).",

                                "description": "Im Vortrag wird klar werden, warum politischer Aktivismus so wichtig ist und dass er eigentlich gar nicht so schwer ist, wenn man ein paar Dinge beachtet.\r\n\r\nEs hat drei Jahre gebraucht, um die nutzerunfreundliche Praxis des Routerzwangs endlich gesetzlich f\u00fcr ung\u00fcltig zu erkl\u00e4ren. Diese erm\u00f6glicht es Internetanbietern, ihren Kunden ein Endger\u00e4t aufzuzwingen, auf das sie nur geringen Einfluss nehmen k\u00f6nnen. Schlimmer noch: Will man einen eigenen Router anschlie\u00dfen, etwa weil man bestimmte technische Dienste ben\u00f6tigt, Ger\u00e4te auf Basis Freier Software bevorzugt oder ein stromsparenderes Modell einsetzen m\u00f6chte, ist dies bei vielen Anbietern entweder gar nicht m\u00f6glich oder man wird bei Support-Anfragen diskriminiert. Dieses Verhalten von Providern ist in vielerlei Hinsicht h\u00f6chst problematisch, da es hohe Sicherheitsrisiken f\u00fcr Nutzer birgt, fairen Wettbewerb verzerrt und den technologischen Fortschritt hemmt.\r\n\r\nUnd seit einigen Monaten steht die EU-Richtlinie f\u00fcr Funkabschottung auf unserer Agenda, die m\u00f6glicherweise schon bald die Nutzung und Entwicklung von Freier Software auf allen Ger\u00e4ten, die in irgendeiner Art Funkwellen verwenden, enorm einschr\u00e4nkt.\r\n\r\nDie Free Software Foundation Europe, f\u00fcr die der Referent Max Mehl arbeitet, hat schon seit den ersten Debatten vor \u00fcber drei Jahren gegen den Routerzwang angek\u00e4mpft und dabei viele Erfahrungen gesammelt. In Zusammenarbeit mit Freie-Software-Entwicklern, Organisationen wie dem Chaos Computer Club oder Digitalcourage sowie mit Endger\u00e4teherstellern, Verb\u00e4nden und Politik ist es gelungen, den Routerzwang gesetzlich offiziell ab Sommer 2016 zu beenden.\r\n\r\nEin wesentlicher Grund f\u00fcr den Erfolg der Initiative war die Einigkeit innerhalb der Allianz gegen den Routerzwang, dass dieses Problem nur politisch gel\u00f6st werden kann. Technisch g\u00e4be es f\u00fcr einige der aufgelisteten Kritikpunkte sicherlich kurzfristig L\u00f6sungen, doch aus Erfahrung wissen wir, dass das ein Kampf gegen Windm\u00fchlen w\u00e4re und sich das Grundproblem nur weiter verfestigen w\u00fcrde. Dasselbe Ziel verfolgen wir auch f\u00fcr die Funkabschottung.\r\n\r\nDer Referent will daher dazu ermutigen, dass sich mehr Menschen f\u00fcr politische L\u00f6sungen von \u00e4hnlichen Missst\u00e4nden einsetzen. Dazu wird er zum einen den Verlauf des Routerzwangs kurz zusammenfassen und dann anhand dessen skizzieren, wie \u00e4hnliche Probleme \u2013 im gro\u00dfen wie im kleinen Ma\u00dfstab \u2013 angegangen werden k\u00f6nnen: unter anderem durch ausf\u00fchrliche Informationsbeschaffung, den Aufbau von Kontakten, gute Kommunikation und das Aufbauen von Allianzen. W\u00e4hrenddessen wird klar werden, dass man f\u00fcr erfolgreichen politischen Aktivismus kein Hauptzeitlobbyist sein muss, sondern Vielf\u00e4ltigkeit sogar von Vorteil ist.\r\n\r\nBildcredit: Konrad Twardowski, CC BY-SA 2.0",
