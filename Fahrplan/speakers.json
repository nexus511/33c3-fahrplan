Four more documentaries for \"Das Erste\" (ARD) followed. In 2012 she told the story about facebook and its then much speculated about IPO in her documentary “Facebook - Milliardengeschäft Freundschaft” (“Facebook - Billion Dollar Business friendship”). In 2014 her knowledge and her research during the NSA-affair ended in her first book “Überwacht und ausgespäht: Prism, NSA, Facebook \u0026 Co.” (“Monitored and spied out: Prism, NSA, Facebook \u0026 Co.”) which was published in the Lingen Verlag. In 2015 she published her recent documentary \"Schlachtfeld Internet - Wenn das Netz zur Waffe wird\" (\"The Internet as a battlefield\") where Edward Snowden was the main interview partner - she was researching in hundreds of secret NSA documents.\r\n\r\nSvea Eckert studied “Journalism and Communications” and Economics in Hamburg. During that time she published articles and television broadcasts for numerous publishers and TV stations. Amongst them are “Spiegel TV” and “ZDF”.
